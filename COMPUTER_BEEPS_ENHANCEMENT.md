# Computer Beeps Audio Enhancement

## ðŸ”Š Launch Code Audio Implementation

### **Computer Beeps System**
The launch code cracking sequence now features authentic computer beeping sounds that loop continuously during the 30-second animation, enhancing the War Games 1983 experience.

### **Audio Features**
- **File**: `computer-beeps.wav` 
- **Duration**: 3-10 seconds (loops automatically)
- **Volume**: 30% (optimized to not overpower interface sounds)
- **Trigger**: Automatically starts with `/launchcodes` or `/crack` commands
- **Control**: Can be toggled with `/tension` or `/music` commands

### **Technical Implementation**

#### **LaunchCodeService Audio Management**
```typescript
// Audio initialization
private beepsAudio: HTMLAudioElement | null = null;
private audioEnabled: boolean = true;

// Loop configuration for continuous beeping
this.beepsAudio.loop = true;
this.beepsAudio.volume = 0.3;
```

#### **Integration with Animation**
- **Start**: Beeps begin when launch code animation starts
- **Stop**: Automatically stops when animation completes (success or failure)
- **Manual Stop**: Stops when animation is manually interrupted

### **User Commands**

#### **Audio Control**
```text
/tension      - Toggle computer beeps on/off
/music        - Toggle computer beeps on/off
/status       - Show current audio status (includes computer beeps)
```

#### **Launch Code Commands**
```text
/launchcodes  - Start launch code cracking with beeps
/crack        - Alternative command for launch code sequence
```

### **Audio Status Display**
The `/status` command now includes:
```text
COMPUTER BEEPS: ENABLED/DISABLED
```

### **Authentic Experience**
- **Era Appropriate**: Authentic 1980s computer beeping sounds
- **Movie Accurate**: Matches the tension and urgency of War Games
- **Non-Intrusive**: Volume balanced to complement other interface sounds
- **Immersive**: Continuous looping creates sustained tension during code cracking

### **User Benefits**
- âœ… **Enhanced Immersion**: Authentic computer sounds during critical sequences
- âœ… **Audio Feedback**: Clear indication that launch code sequence is active
- âœ… **User Control**: Can be disabled for quiet environments
- âœ… **Balanced Audio**: Won't overpower typing sounds or TTS
- âœ… **Authentic War Games Experience**: True to the 1983 movie atmosphere
