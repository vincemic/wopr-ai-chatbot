# WOPR AI Chatbot - War Games 1983 Emulation

> **ü§ñ AI-Generated Project**: This entire codebase, including comprehensive frontend application, OpenAI integration, test suites, documentation, and deployment configurations, was designed and implemented by **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (Anthropic's AI assistant). The project demonstrates advanced AI-driven software development capabilities, including frontend-only architecture with direct OpenAI integration, testing automation, CI/CD pipeline setup, and technical documentation creation. Every line of code, from the direct OpenAI Chat API integration to the Angular frontend with authentic CRT styling and Playwright end-to-end tests, represents AI-generated software engineering.
> **üß™ AI-Driven Testing Excellence**: The project features a comprehensive Playwright test suite with 16 passing tests across multiple browsers, complete audio mocking for Web Speech API and Audio constructor handling, sophisticated element state management, and OpenAI integration testing. The tests validate slash command functionality (`/help`, `/tts`, `/beep`, `/dialup`, `/tension`, `/reset`, `/apikey`) after removing UI toggle buttons in favor of terminal-style commands, ensuring authentic 1983 computer experience. All test scenarios, mocking strategies, and assertion patterns were designed and implemented by AI.

A complete Visual Studio Code workspace featuring a WOPR (War Operation Plan Response) computer emulation from the 1983 movie "WarGames". This project uses a **frontend-only architecture** with direct OpenAI API integration, featuring an Angular application with authentic CRT terminal styling, text-to-speech, user-provided API key management, and comprehensive fallback systems.
