<!-- WOPR AI Chatbot Workspace Instructions -->

## Project Overview

This workspace contains two projects:

1. **Backend**: .NET Core Web API with Microsoft Semantic Kernel for Azure OpenAI
2. **Frontend**: Angular website with WOPR computer emulation interface

## Backend (.NET Core Web API)

- Uses Microsoft Semantic Kernel framework
- Configured for Azure OpenAI
- Designed for Azure App Service deployment
- Uses local user secrets for development
- Serves as chatbot backend

## Frontend (Angular)

- Latest Angular framework
- Playwright for functional testing
- WOPR computer emulation interface (1983 War Games movie)
- CRT/dot-matrix styling
