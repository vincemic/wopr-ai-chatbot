<!-- WOPR AI Chatbot Workspace Instructions -->

## Project Overview
This workspace contains two projects:
1. **Backend**: .NET Core Web API with Microsoft Semantic Kernel for Azure OpenAI
2. **Frontend**: Angular website with WOPR computer emulation interface

## Backend (.NET Core Web API)
- Uses Microsoft Semantic Kernel framework
- Configured for Azure OpenAI
- Designed for Azure App Service deployment
