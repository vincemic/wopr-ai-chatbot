<!-- WOPR AI Chatbot Workspace Instructions -->

## Project Overview
This workspace contains a **frontend-only application**:
1. **Frontend**: Angular application with direct OpenAI integration and WOPR computer emulation interface

## Architecture
- **Frontend-Only**: Angular application with direct OpenAI Chat API integration
- **No Backend Required**: Complete WOPR experience runs entirely in the browser
- **User-Provided API Keys**: Secure localStorage-based OpenAI API key management
- **Direct API Integration**: Browser-to-OpenAI communication using fetch API

## Frontend (Angular)
- Latest Angular framework (18+)
- Playwright for comprehensive end-to-end testing
- WOPR computer emulation interface (1983 War Games movie)
- Authentic CRT/dot-matrix styling with phosphor glow effects
- Text-to-speech capabilities with robotic voice
- Web Audio API for terminal beeping and dial-up sounds
- Launch code computer beeps with authentic 1980s computer sounds
- Direct OpenAI Chat API integration with gpt-4o-mini model
- Intelligent fallback system for when no API key is configured
- Mobile touch support with haptic feedback
- Slash command interface (/help, /apikey, /tts, /beep, /dialup, /tension, /reset)

## Development Guidelines
- Keep WOPR character authentic to the 1983 War Games movie
- Implement retro CRT styling with dot-matrix text effects
- Ensure text-to-speech sounds computer-like
- Maintain terminal-style command interface
- Provide helpful fallback messages when OpenAI API key is not configured
- Support both desktop and mobile interactions
- Ensure audio features work across different browsers
